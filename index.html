        <h1>Phy6</h1>
        <p>Phy6 is a game that was made for a CS class. The game is made in LWJGL (Java) and has been put on hold while I work on learning Game Engine design, so that I may work on it more efficiently.</p>
        <p>The source code for Phy6 can be found <a href="https://github.com/justinbrick/Phy6">here.</a></p>

        <h1>Punching Simulator</h1>
        <p>Punching Simulator is a game made in Roblox, and my current project. The game is made with the intentions of being both a creative outlet and a demonstration for knowledge of all languages, practical or impractical. It also demonstrates knowledge of animating, modelling, and mapping, aside from programming.</p>
